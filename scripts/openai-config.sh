# Override the model for any script via the OPENAI_MODEL env var, e.g.
#   OPENAI_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o ./scripts/git-commit.sh
# (a bare model name without a provider prefix is assumed to be OpenAI's,
# so pre-gateway overrides like OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o keep working).

# Single source of truth for the default model. Change it here once and every
# script that sources this file picks it up.

# reasoning-style models (gpt-5*, o1/o3/o4*) differ from the gpt-4 family:
#   - they reject a custom `temperature` (only the default is allowed);
#   - on the Chat Completions API they require `max_completion_tokens`
#     instead of `max_tokens`;
#   - they spend output tokens on hidden reasoning, so they need a larger
#     output-token budget to actually emit a result.
# Non-OpenAI providers are treated as reasoning-family: the larger output
# budget is harmless, and omitting `temperature` avoids 400s from models
# that reject the field.
